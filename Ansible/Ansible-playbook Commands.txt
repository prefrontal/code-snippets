# To check if a playbook is correctly formatted, the option --syntax-check 
# looks at all involved playbooks and verifies the correct syntax. 

	ansible-playbook --syntax-check oraclejdk-destroy.yml
	
# The option --list-hosts will output a list of affected hosts, including the 
# name of the actual play and the pattern with which the hosts were chosen

	ansible-playbook --list-hosts oraclejdk-destroy.yml

# The option --list-tasks lists what will be done, showing the names of the 
# tasks but not executing any of them on the target nodes

	ansible-playbook --list-tasks oraclejdk-destroy.yml
	
# The used tags can be listed as well

	ansible-playbook --list-tags setup-control.yml

# Invoked via --check the check mode does not alter the target nodes, 
# but tries to output what would change and what not.

	ansible-playbook --check oraclejdk-setup.yml
	
# One way to debug everything is to go through each task at a time, 
# step by step, checking the state of all involved components after each task. 
# This can be done with the option --step.

	ansible-playbook --step oraclejdk-setup.yml

# Many files can change as part of a playbook. In such cases, the option 
# --diff comes in handy: it shows the diff in typical patch form

	ansible-playbook --diff examples/template.yml
